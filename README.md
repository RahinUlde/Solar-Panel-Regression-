# 🌞 Solar Panel Power Generation Prediction ⚡

This project predicts the **power generated by solar panels** based on weather and environmental factors.  
It applies **Machine Learning regression models** to forecast solar power output, helping in renewable energy optimization.  
The final best-performing model is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive predictions.

## 🔎 Overview
Solar energy generation depends on environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sky cover.  
In this project:
- Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering were performed.
- Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) were trained and evaluated.
- The **Random Forest Regressor** gave the best performance.
- A **Streamlit app** was built for interactive solar power prediction.
